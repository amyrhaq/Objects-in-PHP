<!-- Below there is a Person class, so every new Person has some properties, like $isAlive or $firstname, and a method greet(). 
Right now there is only one instance of the Person class: $me. 
But we'll reconstruct this class and you'll even create another instance of the class, so your name will be echod, too. -->
